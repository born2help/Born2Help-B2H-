      <h2>Founder’s Message</h2>
      <p>My name is Mubashir Munnawar.<br>
         B2H was born from a simple belief: technology can be structured to help humanity while remaining ethical, lawful, and transparent.<br>
         I am not wealthy, but I am committed to protecting the integrity of this project for as long as I am able.<br>
         B2H exists to explore a new idea: that participation in technology can be <strong>an act of service to humanity</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>This project is humanitarian-first. Participation involves risk. B2H <strong>does not guarantee financial returns</strong>, price appreciation, or wealth generation. All engagement should be done with full understanding of its ethical, social, and voluntary nature.</p>
