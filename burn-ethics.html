        reduce suffering,

    <h3>What “Burn” Means in B2H</h3>

    <p>
      In many projects, burns are used only to create hype or artificial scarcity.
      B2H rejects that mindset.
    </p>

    <p>
      In B2H, a burn represents a conscious decision:
      value is reduced in one place so that relief, stability,
      and long-term service can exist elsewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not about making numbers look attractive.
      It is about making impact possible.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>How Burns Serve Humanity</h3>

    <p>
      When burns occur in B2H, they are linked to real-world responsibility.
      A portion of what is sacrificed is directed toward humanitarian purpose,
      operational sustainability, and continued service.
    </p>

    <p>
      This allows B2H to help people today
      without destroying the future of the project tomorrow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Helping people is not treated as a marketing strategy —
      it is treated as an obligation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Protection for Participants</h3>

    <p>
      B2H understands that people who participate
      are also thinking about their families,
      their children,
      and long-term security.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this reason, burns are designed with balance:
      never reckless,
      never emotional,
      never driven by short-term pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is sustainability —
      so that helping others does not require sacrificing trust.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Faith, Accountability & Permanence</h3>

    <p>
      This project exists with a belief
      that Allah sees intention before outcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every burn is carried out with accountability,
      transparency,
      and respect for human dignity.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a burn does not serve humanity,
      strengthen the mission,
      or protect participants,
      it does not belong in B2H.
