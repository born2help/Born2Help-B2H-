  <section class="section">
    <h3>Burn to Help Mechanism</h3>
    <p>
      B2H introduces a structured Burn-to-Help mechanism. Each burn permanently
      reduces supply while triggering allocations toward humanitarian initiatives
      and long-term project sustainability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns are designed to align economic participation with compassion, without
      guaranteeing financial returns.

      B2H is built on ethical principles. We do not promise profits. We do not
      misuse humanitarian funds. Transparency, accountability, and long-term
      trust guide every decision.

    <h3>Transparency & Humanitarian Commitment</h3>
    <p>
      B2H is committed to ethical conduct, transparency, and responsible
      stewardship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Funds allocated for humanitarian purposes are dedicated exclusively to
      supporting verified charitable initiatives and assistance for the poor.
      Operational and treasury funds are managed separately to ensure clarity and
      accountability.
    </p>
    <p>
      B2H does not promise financial returns. Participation involves risk, and
      value is determined by adoption, trust, and real-world impact.

    <p>
      Transparency reports and updates will be shared publicly as the project
      grows.

  <!-- FOUNDER MESSAGE -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Founder’s Message</h3>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Mubashir Munnawar</strong>.<br>
      B2H (Burn to Help | Born for Humanity) was born from a simple belief:
      that humanity can use technology responsibly to serve people in need.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is built on patience, transparency, and long-term responsibility.
      There are no guaranteed returns, no hidden agendas, and no rush. Participation,
      if any, is voluntary and based on shared values—not promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not a wealthy person, but I believe sincerity, accountability, and faith
      in doing the right thing matter more than capital. My commitment is to protect
      the integrity of this project for as long as I am able.
    </p>
    <p>
      B2H exists to explore a new idea: that technology can be structured to help
      humanity while remaining ethical, lawful, and transparent.
    </p>
    <p>— Founder, B2H</p>
