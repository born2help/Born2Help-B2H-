  <h3>Burn to Help — What It Means</h3>
  <p>
    In B2H, burning is not destruction. It is a conscious act of responsibility.
    Every burn exists to protect dignity, reduce suffering, and sustain the mission.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike other projects that burn for hype or scarcity, B2H burns represent intentional reduction of value
    to create real-world impact, stability, and relief.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a burn does not serve humanity, strengthen the mission, or protect participants, it does not belong in B2H.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>How Burns Serve Humanity</h3>
  <p>
    A portion of what is sacrificed is directed toward humanitarian purpose,
    operational sustainability, and continued service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Helping people is not treated as a marketing strategy — it is an obligation.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Protection for Participants</h3>
  <p>
    B2H designs burns with balance: never reckless, never emotional, never driven by short-term pressure.
    The goal is sustainability so helping others does not sacrifice trust.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Faith, Accountability & Permanence</h3>
  <p>
    Every burn is carried out with accountability, transparency, and respect for human dignity.
  </p>

<!-- ================= ETHICS SECTION ================= -->
<section class="section" id="ethics">
  <h3>Ethics in B2H</h3>
  <p>
    All actions are guided by responsibility, transparency, and fairness.
    Every participant, decision, and movement aligns with humanitarian and faith-based principles.
  </p>
  <p>
    B2H rejects exploitation, interest (Riba), and any personal enrichment.
    Every contribution serves humanity only.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Core Ethical Principles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Transparency in all funds and actions</li>
    <li>Accountability for every decision</li>
    <li>Protection of dignity over profit</li>
    <li>Voluntary participation and informed consent</li>
  </ul>

<!-- ================= FOUNDER SAFEGUARDS ================= -->
<section class="section" id="founder">
  <h3>Founder Safeguards</h3>
  <p>
    The Founder holds no ownership or financial privilege. Authority exists only to safeguard
    values, prevent misuse, and activate protections when ethical deviations occur.
  </p>
  <p>
    Transparency rules, financial locks, audit pathways, and mission-freeze mechanisms
    ensure that no single individual can override purpose or accountability.
