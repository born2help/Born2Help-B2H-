  <h1>Transparency Framework</h1>
  <p>
    Transparency in B2H exists to protect trust —
    not to expose the vulnerable,
    enable exploitation,
    or invite harm.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="transparency-section">
  <h3>Why Transparency Has Limits</h3>
  <p>
    Absolute transparency is not always ethical.
    In humanitarian work, exposure can cause
    risk, misuse, and real-world harm.
  </p>
  <p>
    B2H rejects transparency theater.
    Responsibility matters more than visibility.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="transparency-section soft">
  <h3>What B2H Commits to Disclose</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Mission purpose and ethical constraints</li>
    <li>Governance structure and safeguards</li>
    <li>Participation principles and risk warnings</li>
    <li>High-level humanitarian impact summaries</li>
    <li>Use-of-funds categories (non-exploitable)</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="transparency-section">
  <h3>What B2H Will Not Publicly Disclose</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Exact wallet addresses or internal accounts</li>
    <li>Detailed logistics of aid distribution</li>
    <li>Personal identities of beneficiaries</li>
    <li>Security-sensitive operational data</li>
    <li>Private continuity designations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Withholding information protects people —
    not power.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="transparency-section soft">
  <h3>Financial Communication Boundaries</h3>
  <p>
    B2H does not publish price targets,
    profit projections,
    or speculative forecasts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Financial transparency exists only
    within ethical and humanitarian boundaries.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="transparency-section">
  <h3>Use of Funds — Ethical Disclosure</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Humanitarian assistance</li>
    <li>Operational sustainability</li>
    <li>Security, compliance, and protection</li>
    <li>Minimal logistics and coordination</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Excess, luxury, or extraction
    is explicitly prohibited.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="transparency-section soft">
  <h3>Privacy as Protection</h3>
  <p>
    Public exposure of suffering
    leads to stigma, targeting,
    and exploitation.
  </p>
  <p>
    B2H protects dignity
    by refusing to turn suffering
    into content.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="transparency-section">
  <h3>Independent Accountability (When Safe)</h3>
  <p>
    Where feasible and safe,
    trusted ethical reviewers
    may privately verify practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    No reviewer may claim control,
    influence, or authority.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="transparency-section soft">
  <h3>Handling Misinformation</h3>
  <p>
    Any individual claiming guaranteed returns,
    inside access,
    or special authority
    does not represent B2H.
  </p>
  <p>
    Silence in response to hype
    is intentional.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="transparency-section">
  <h3>Amanah (Trust)</h3>
  <p>
    In Islamic accountability,
    amanah is sacred.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trust is broken not only by lies,
    but by careless truth
    that causes harm.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="transparency-section soft">
  <h3>Final Principle</h3>
  <p>
    B2H will always choose
    responsible restraint
    over harmful exposure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Transparency serves people —
    people do not serve transparency.
